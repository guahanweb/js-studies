# JavaScript Studies
Just a repo in which to host some of my personal coding studies.

### Linked Lists
I have read several different articles about the use of linked lists in JavaScript, so
I have started to toy around with a few different mechanisms to see how I might be able
to implement them in an optimized way.

### Funcional Arithmetic
Introduced to this concept with an intermediate coding challenge, it really is a simple
problem that has some relatively advanced techniques involved. In my solution, I have
attempted to create as narrow a code base as possible to avoid any duplication.

#### The Problem
```JavaScript
/* Support all four basic arithmetic operations in a functional way. */

one(plus(two())); // 3
two(plus(one())); // 3

three(minus(two())); // 1
three(times(two())); // 6
four(dividedby(two())); // 2
```
